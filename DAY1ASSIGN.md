List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning

Creating a project roadmap, estimating costs, setting timelines, and allocating resources to ensure a smooth development process.

2.Requirement Analysis

Understanding and gathering user needs, business objectives, and technical requirements to define the project scope.

3.Design

Structuring the software architecture, database models, UI/UX design, and system workflows to provide a blueprint for development.
4.Development (Implementation)

Writing code based on the design specifications, integrating various components, and building the functional software.
5.Testing

Identifying and fixing bugs by running various tests (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance) to ensure quality and performance.
6.Deployment

Releasing the software to users or production environments while ensuring smooth integration and functionality.
7.Maintenance & Updates

Monitoring performance, fixing issues, and updating the software to enhance security, usability, and compatibility over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where development progresses through well-defined phases: Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, making it ideal for projects with fixed requirements and little expected change.

This methodology is particularly useful when projects require strict compliance and heavy documentation, such as in medical software development or government IT systems. Additionally, industries like aerospace benefit from Waterfall, as software for aircraft control systems must adhere to stringent specifications without room for frequent modifications.

However, Waterfall’s rigid structure makes it difficult to accommodate changes once development has started. If requirements evolve mid-project, significant rework may be needed, leading to increased costs and delays.

2.Agile Methodology
In contrast, Agile is a flexible and iterative approach, where development occurs in short cycles called sprints. Instead of following a fixed sequence, Agile emphasizes continuous feedback, collaboration, and adaptability. Testing is conducted throughout the process, ensuring that changes can be made dynamically based on evolving requirements.

Agile is best suited for projects with uncertain or frequently changing requirements, such as startup mobile applications or e-commerce platforms where user feedback drives updates. Additionally, it is highly effective for AI-driven applications, where iterative improvements refine machine learning models and enhance software performance.

One of Agile’s key strengths is its focus on customer collaboration and rapid delivery. Unlike Waterfall, where a final product is delivered at the end, Agile allows for incremental releases, enabling teams to adjust based on real-world use. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of less predictability in budgeting and timelines, as requirements may shift during development.

Choosing the Right Approach
The choice between Waterfall and Agile depends on project requirements, industry constraints, and adaptability needs. If a project demands strict planning, compliance, and stability, Waterfall is the preferred approach. However, if fast adaptation, iterative development, and customer involvement are key priorities, Agile is the better choice
